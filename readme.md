# Gibbabyte Utilities' Dictionary API NodeJS Wrapper (GUDPAI)
GUDPAI is a free-to-access online dictionary database consisting of multiple languages. This system was designed and developed by Gibbabyte LLC in attempt to create a safe and secure universal dictionary system. We try our best to keep information relevant, up-to-date, and accurate. I have created this tool for easy access to the API without having to go through the trouble of XMLHttpRequests.
